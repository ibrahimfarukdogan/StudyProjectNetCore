This project made by Ibrahim Faruk Dogan at UnityVerse Academy Reactjs Course

at backend I used vs2022 and .Net Mvc web api
at frontend I used vscode and reactjs

For running the project you need the nodejs, also you need to use "npm install" while at frontend folder.
After that run the frontend with "npm run dev"

For backend just open it up and run the project at vs2022. But you need to add values at the database tables manually to make the frontend work.
Lastly project frontend ui taken from here: https://www.figma.com/design/zxDkWjnvqt5MsuCeiz7d89/Consulting-Webflow-Website-Template-(Community)-(Copy)?node-id=1-5
