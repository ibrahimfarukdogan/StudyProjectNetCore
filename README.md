This project made by Ibrahim Faruk Dogan at UnityVerse Academy Reactjs Course

at backend I used vs2022 and .Net Mvc web api
at frontend I used vscode and reactjs

For running the project you need the nodejs, also you need to use "npm install" while at frontend folder.
After that run the frontend with "npm run dev"

For backend just open it up and while in package terminal, you write "Add-Migration database" and then "update-database". After database is ready, run the project at vs2022. 
But you need to add values for frontend work. So for this you copy BackendDb.bak file from backend folder and paste it to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup folder
Then in sql server 2022, You right click to backend and from the menu you click: Tasks->Restore->Database and select the BackendDb.bak from the list
